Exercise 1: Add a Paragraph Inside a Div
Inside a <div>, insert an <h1> element with the text:
 Technology

Below the <h1>, add a <p> tag with the text:
 Artificial intelligence is transforming industries across the globe.

Exercise 2: Use a <span> to Highlight Inline Text
Inside the paragraph from Exercise 1, wrap the phrase
 Artificial intelligence
 with a <span> tag to separate it from the rest of the sentence.

Exercise 3: Practice Inline vs Block Elements
Below your first <div>, create a second <div>.
Inside this new <div>, add a paragraph with this sentence:
 Electric vehicles are becoming more popular each year.

Wrap the phrase
 Electric vehicles
 in a <span> element.

Exercise 4: Demonstrate Improper Span Usage
Create a new <span> element that contains this full block of text:
 This entire block of text is incorrectly placed inside a span element.

Observe how the browser still displays it, but understand that this is semantically incorrect.

Exercise 5: Comment on Best Practices
Above your second <div>, add an HTML comment that reads:
 Best practice: Use span for inline text, not entire blocks. -->

    <div>
      <h1>Technology</h1>
      <p>
        <span>Artificial intelligence</span> is transforming industries across
        the globe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Best practice: Use span for inline text, not entire blocks. -->
    <div>
      <p><span>Electric vehicles</span> are becoming more popular each year.</p>
    </div>
    <span
      >This entire block of text is incorrectly placed inside a span
      element.</span
    >
  </body>
