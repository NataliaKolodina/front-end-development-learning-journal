<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 1: Create the Project Folder Structure (On Paper or Mentally)
Before writing HTML:
Visualize a folder named project-folder that contains three HTML files.
The file names must be exactly:
 index.html  
 about.html  
 contact.html  
No need to code this structure â€” just understand the setup for the next steps.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 2: Add an Anchor Tag with a Relative Path
Inside the <body> of your index.html file:
Create an anchor element.
Set the href attribute to a relative path linking to contact.html in the same folder.
The link text must be:
 Contact Us
Do not use an absolute URL.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 3: Add a Link to Another Internal Page
Still in index.html:
Add another anchor element below the first one.
Set the href attribute to:
 ./about.html
The text inside the link must be:
 Learn More About Us
Do not include any target attributes.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 4: Add a Descriptive Comment Above Each Link
Above the first anchor element:
Insert a comment that says exactly:
 This link goes to the Contact page
Above the second anchor element:
Insert a comment that says exactly:
 This link goes to the About page
Each comment must be on its own line, above the link it describes.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 5: Link Back to the Home Page from Another File
Open the about.html file:
Inside the <body> element, add an anchor element.
Set the href attribute to a relative path linking to:
 ./index.html
Set the text of the link to:
 Return to Home
Do not include any other text or attributes.
====================================== -->
