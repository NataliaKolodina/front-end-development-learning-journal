<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 1: Create the Basic Page Structure
At the top of your HTML file, declare the document type for HTML5.
Then, open the main HTML element.
Inside it, create both the <head> and <body> sections.
Leave both sections empty for now.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 2: Add a Title to the Page
Inside the <head> section, insert a <title> element.
Set the text inside the <title> to exactly:
 My Coding Journal
Do not add any other content to the <head> yet.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 3: Observe the Browser Tab
Save and open your HTML file in a browser.
Check the browser tab and verify that it displays:
 My Coding Journal
If it does not display correctly, check that the <title> is correctly placed inside the <head>.
Do not modify the title text or location.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 4: Change the Page Title
Now go back and change the text inside your <title> element.
Replace it with:
 Brown Bear Facts
Make sure the change appears in the browser tab after refreshing the page.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 5: Place the Title in the Correct Location
Move your <title> element outside of the <head> and into the <body> section.
Save and open the file in the browser.
Observe what happens. Then, move the <title> back into the <head>.
This step helps you understand that the <title> must be inside the <head> to work properly.
