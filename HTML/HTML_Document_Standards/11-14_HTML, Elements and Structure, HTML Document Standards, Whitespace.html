<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 1: Create a Compact Line of Code
Inside the <body> element of your HTML page, add two paragraph elements. 
Write both <p> elements on the same line with no line breaks or indentation. 
Each paragraph must contain the following exact text: 
 Paragraph A 
 Paragraph B 
Make sure the code appears on one single line only.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 2: Use Whitespace to Separate Elements
Rewrite the paragraph elements from Exercise 1. 
Place each <p> element on its own line inside the <body> element.
Do not add any indentation before the <p> tags. Only use line breaks.
The paragraph text must remain the same:
 Paragraph A 
 Paragraph B 
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 3: Add Proper Indentation
Keep each paragraph element on its own line inside the <body>.
Now indent both paragraph elements using four spaces before each tag.
Use the same text content:
 Paragraph A 
 Paragraph B 
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 4: Add a Nested Structure with Indentation
Inside the <body> element, add a <div> element on its own line.
Inside the <div>, add two <p> elements.
Each element must be on its own line.
Indent the <p> elements with four spaces, and the <div> with no indentation.
The <p> elements should have the following text:
 First nested paragraph 
 Second nested paragraph 
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 5: Test the Rendering
Keep the structure from Exercise 4 exactly the same.
Below the <div>, add a third <p> element on its own line (not inside the <div>).
Indent the third <p> element with four spaces.
Use this exact text:
 Paragraph outside div 
All three paragraphs must be rendered on the browser as separate lines.
====================================== -->


    <p>Paragraph A </p> 
    <p>Paragraph B </p>

<div>
    <p>First nested paragraph </p>
    <p>Second nested paragraph</p>
</div>

    <p>Paragraph outside div</p>

</body>
