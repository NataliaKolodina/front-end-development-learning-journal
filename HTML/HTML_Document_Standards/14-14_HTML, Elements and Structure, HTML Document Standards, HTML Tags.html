<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 1: Declare the HTML Document Type
At the very top of your HTML file, before any other lines, declare the type of document.
This line must inform the browser that the file uses the HTML5 standard.
Do not add any spacing or content above it.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 2: Structure the HTML Page
Start your HTML document by adding the root element that wraps all other content.
Inside this root element, add two child elements:
- One for page metadata and title
- One for the visible content
Do not insert any content yet. Only the structure is required.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 3: Add Metadata and Title
Inside the section where metadata goes, add the title of the page.
The title should say exactly: My First HTML Page
This title should appear in the browser tab when the page is loaded.
Do not include any visible elements yet.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 4: Create a Link to an Internal Section
Inside the visible content section:
1. Create a heading that says: Welcome to My Page
2. Below the heading, add a link that says: Go to Info Section
3. The link must jump to another section on the same page, using an anchor
4. Create a new section further down the page with an ID set to: info
5. Inside that section, add a subheading that says: Info Section

Do not use placeholder text. Use only the exact content provided.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 5: Format for Readability
Organize your HTML code to include:
- Indentation that clearly shows parent-child relationships
- Whitespace between major elements to improve readability
Your browser will ignore these formatting details, but they must be present in your code.
Use at least 3 levels of nesting to demonstrate structure.
====================================== -->
<!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 6: Insert a Valid Comment
Inside the visible content section, but before the Info Section,
add a comment that says exactly:
 This paragraph explains the author's bio
The comment must be syntactically correct and must not include any HTML elements inside.
====================================== -->

<h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
<a href="#info">Go to Info Section</a>
<!-- This paragraph explains the author's bio -->
<section id="info">
    <h2>Info Section</h2>
</section>
