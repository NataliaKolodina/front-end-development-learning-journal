✅ Exercise 1: Add the Body Element
Inside an <html> element, add a pair of <body> tags.


Leave the <body> empty for now.



✅ Exercise 2: Place Text Inside the Body
Inside the <body>, add a single paragraph.


The paragraph must say:
 Hello, this is my first body content.


Make sure the text appears when rendered.



✅ Exercise 3: Test a Paragraph Outside the Body
Above the <body> tag, add another paragraph.


Use this exact text:
 I should not be here.


Open the page in a browser and observe what happens.


Delete that paragraph after testing.



✅ Exercise 4: Add a Second Paragraph
Inside the <body>, directly below the first paragraph, add a second one.


The text should be:
 "Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." – Audre Lorde



✅ Exercise 5: Comment for Future You
At the top of your body section, before any paragraphs, add a comment.


The comment should say:
 All content must go inside the body tags -->

    <!-- All content must go inside the body tags -->
    <p>Hello, this is my first body content.</p>
    <p>
      "Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." –
      Audre Lorde
    </p>
