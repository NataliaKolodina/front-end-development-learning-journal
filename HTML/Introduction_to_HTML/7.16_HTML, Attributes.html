    <!-- 7.16_HTML, Attributes
Exercise 1: Add an ID Attribute to a Section
Inside the <body> of your HTML document, create a <div> element that contains a level 1 heading (h1) with the text:
 Welcome to My Page
Assign an id to this <div> with the value:
 main-header
The id must appear inside the opening tag of the <div>.

Exercise 2: Create a Div with a Unique ID and Content
Below the previous <div>, create another <div> element. Inside it, include a level 2 heading (h2) that says:
 About the Author
Assign the id attribute to this new <div> with the value:
 author-section

Exercise 3: Nest a Paragraph Inside an Identified Div
Inside the <div> with the id set to author-section, add a paragraph with the following text:
 This site was created by Jamie, a web development student.
Make sure the paragraph is properly indented and that no other content is outside the <div>.

Exercise 4: Identify a Media Section
After the author section, create a new <div> element.
Assign it an id of media-box.
Inside this <div>, add a level 2 heading that says:
 Media
Also add a paragraph that says:
 Multimedia files will be displayed here.
All content must be fully nested within the <div>.

Exercise 5: Misplace an ID — Then Correct It
Create a new <div> below the previous ones. Inside it, add a heading with the text:
 Contact Us
Then, assign the id attribute incorrectly — write it inside the closing tag.
Observe what happens when the page is rendered.
Next, correct your mistake by placing the id in the correct place.
Use contact-section as the value for the id. -->
