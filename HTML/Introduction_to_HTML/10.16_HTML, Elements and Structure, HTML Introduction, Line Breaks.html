    <!-- 10.16_HTML, Elements and Structure, HTML Introduction, Line Breaks -->
    <!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 1: Insert a Line Break Inside a Paragraph
Create a paragraph that contains this sentence:
The Nile River is the longest river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).
Insert a line break after the word “river”, and another after the number “6,850”.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 2: Use Multiple Line Breaks
Inside a new paragraph, write this text:
This is a line of text.
Then, insert **three** line breaks (<br>) after it, followed by the sentence:
This appears much lower on the page.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 3: Practice a Line Break Within a Heading
Create an <h2> heading that says:
Mount Everest is
the highest mountain.
Use a line break to split the text into two lines exactly at the word “is”.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 4: Demonstrate Line Break Tag Alone
Add a line break tag (<br>) by itself between two existing paragraphs in your code. Do not include any text in between.
Ensure it creates a visible spacing effect.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 5: Misuse and Correction
Write a line of text:
Line breaks should be used properly.
Incorrectly attempt to close the <br> tag like this: <br></br>
Then, **comment out** the incorrect tag and add a correct version below it.
====================================== -->

    <p>
      The Nile River is the longest river <br />
      in the world, measuring over 6,850 <br />
      kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      This is a line of text.<br /><br /><br />This appears much lower on the
      page.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Mount Everest is <br />
      the highest mountain.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Line breaks should
      <!-- <br></br> -->
      <br />
      be used properly.
    </p>
