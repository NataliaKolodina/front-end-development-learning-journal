    <!-- 2.16_HTML, HTML Anatomy -->
    <!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 1: Create a Paragraph Element
Inside the <body> element, create a complete paragraph element.
Use the opening tag <p>, write the text:
This is a paragraph.
Then close the element with a proper closing tag.
Do not add any other elements or attributes.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 2: Identify and Label the Parts of an Element
Create a second paragraph element under the first.
Write a comment directly above each of these:
1. The opening tag
2. The content
3. The closing tag
Use these exact comments (one per line): -->
    <!-- Opening tag  -->
    <!-- Content -->
    <!-- Closing tag -->
    <!-- The text content of the paragraph should be:
Learning HTML is fun!
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 3: Add Multiple Elements with Different Content
Below the second paragraph, insert three more paragraph elements.
Each paragraph should contain one line of text:
1. My name is Alex.  
2. I am learning HTML.  
3. Paragraphs are used for text.
Do not nest the paragraphs or include any other elements.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 4: Use a Different Type of Element
Below the three paragraphs, insert a <div> element.
Inside the <div>, add the text:
This is inside a div element.
Ensure the div has a proper opening and closing tag.
Do not add any other elements inside or outside the <div>.
====================================== -->
    <!-- ======================================
ðŸ”¸ EXERCISE 5: Use Improper Syntax and Then Fix It
At the bottom of the page, write a paragraph element with the following incorrect structure:
<p>Forgot to close
Then, on the next line, write the corrected version of the same element, properly closed.
Use the text:
Now it's properly closed.
Do not remove the incorrect version; leave both for comparison.
====================================== -->

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!-- Opening tag  -->
    <p>
      <!-- Content -->
      Learning HTML is fun!
      <!-- Closing tag -->
    </p>
    <p>My name is Alex.</p>
    <p>I am learning HTML.</p>
    <p>Paragraphs are used for text.</p>

    <div>This is inside a div element.</div>
    <p>Forgot to close</p>
    <p>Now it's properly closed.</p>
  </body>
