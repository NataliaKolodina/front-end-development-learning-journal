    <!-- 4.16_HTML,Structure
Exercise 1: Structure the Page
Create an HTML document with a <body> element.
Inside the <body>, add a heading with the text: Welcome to My Page.
Below the heading, add a paragraph with the text: This is the first visible element.
Use two spaces of indentation for the paragraph element.
Exercise 2: Nest and Identify
Inside the <body>, add a <div> element.
Inside the <div>, add the following in order:
A heading level 1 with the text: Section Title
A paragraph with the text: This is a paragraph inside a div.
Indent all child elements inside the <div> using two spaces.
Exercise 3: Use Deep Nesting
Below the previous <div>, add another <div>.
Inside this second <div>, nest a third <div>.
Inside the innermost <div>, insert a paragraph with the exact text:
 This is a deeply nested paragraph.
Use two spaces of indentation for each level of nesting.
Exercise 4: Demonstrate Sibling Relationship
Inside the outermost <body> tag, create a <div> element.
Inside that <div>, add these elements as siblings:
A heading level 2 with the text: Sibling Heading
A paragraph with the text: Sibling Paragraph
Make sure they are both nested with equal indentation and clearly inside the same parent <div>.
Exercise 5: Demonstrate Parent and Child Relationship
Add a <footer> element at the bottom of the <body>.
Inside the <footer>, add a paragraph with the text:
 This paragraph is a child of the footer.
Use proper indentation to show the child element clearly. -->
